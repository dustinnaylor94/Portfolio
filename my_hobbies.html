    <h4>Building a Computer is a Blast!</h4>


    <h2>How Did I Get Into PC Building?</h2>
    <p>A hobby I got into within the last year is custom built PC's. Most of my life I have enjoyed playing some video games, and after
        returning home form an LDS mission I found PC gaming to be pretty cool. The only thing was that I didn't have a sufficient computer
        to play these games. My laptop I bought for school which has an ok i5 processor and Nvidia 940m graphics card could just barely run the
        games I wanted to play, and felt like it was about to catch fire! Building a computer always sounded like it would be a cool
        thing to accomplish, so I decided to look into building my own desktop computer. Currently this is what my setup looks like:

    <h2>What's In My PC?</h2>
    <p>Over the last year my PC has changed slightly, and that's really one of the funnest parts of having one! When I started out I took
    whatever I could from my Dad's old computer that didn't really run anymore. Ultimately what I harvested from it's cold carcass was
    the case itself, which didn't offer stellar airflow, wasn't a looker, and had no support for a 2.5" storage drive (which both of my
    storage devices are 2.5"), and I was able to utilize the power supply, which actually isn't half bad. Everything else I had to buy
    new. I now have upgraded my case and case fans. All said, I spent roughly $600 dollars to build a pretty killer mid-range PC that
    can play any game I want on decently high graphics. The prices below reflect current prices of all my components, not
    necessarily what I paid for them. Here's what is in my PC:</p>
