            <h2>Favorite Movies 2017</h2>
            <p>Last year was a good year for movies!<br/>
                Picking my favorite 5 from last year definitely was no<br/>
                easy choice. With movies like <span>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</span><br/>
                and <span>Thor: Ragnarok</span>, which one could possibly take<br/>
                the title for Best Movie 2017? Come look at my thoughts!

            <h2>Youth Futures</h2>
            <p>This page isn't one that I've designed on my own
                but was an already existing webpage. I was tasked
                with recreating it. A good skill to have as a
                web developer is the ability to manipulate
                elements to place them exactly how you want them!

            <p>MadLibs are a fun game where you are asked to provide a list of
                random words. The words you give are then placed into blank spaces
                in a story! This can end up in some HILARIOUS results!

    <h2>Learning React at Work</h2>
    <p> In my internship with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
        I have been learning React.<br/>
        React is a Javascript framework that allows for the creation of reactive, reusable components
        that actively update whenever a change is made. Learning React has been a big, but exciting, new challenge
        for me. I enjoy learning how this framework communicates with a database to keep page elements live and up to date</p>
