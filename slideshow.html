            I love Saabs! But I haven't always loved these vehicles as much as I
            do now. Infact, I didn't even know what a Saab was until 2015! When I
            returned from serving an LDS mission, I was gifted a non-working 1990
            Hyundai Excel. THAT THING WAS GUTLESS! But it got me around. After a while
            I started to get sick of this little old car with over 250k miles on it.
            One day I got together with my buddy, Justin, and he had bought an interesting
            new car: a Saab 900 SPG in Edwarian Grey. It was so unique, and quite comfy!
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually I found myself searching KSL for cars and remembered Justin's Saab. I
            did some searches and asked my friend some questions and eventually happened upon
            a 1990 Saab 900 SPG in Talledega Red for only $2000 dollars. I took one test drive
            of this beautiful little turbocharged car and instantly fell in love. Today, it is still
            my daily driver, 2 and a half years later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually I got my wife to switch from a Toyota Corolla into a gorgeous 2006 Saab 9-3
            Sportcombi Aero. This car has a whopping 320 hoarsepower as compared to the Corolla's
            mighty 130. She loves it! To this day, I love Saabs and hope to be able to hang on to my
            900 for the rest of my life and restore it to it's total potential.
