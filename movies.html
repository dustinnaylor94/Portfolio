    <h2>My Taste</h2>
    <p>My taste in movies spans a pretty wide variety, but I'd have to say over-all I enjoy lighter-weight, positive movies
    that leave me feeling, well, happy. I find I tend to watch movies with a decent amount of comedy in them, but also a good
    action movie with a good plot captivates me. If I can get an action movie with humor incorporated into it, then it takes the
    cake!

    <h2>Is There a Number One?</h2>
    <p>Out of all the movies I saw over the past year, there are 2 that compete in my mind for the best movie I saw last year.
    I saw Thor earlier in the year and is easily the best Marvel movie to date. It took the humor of marvel movies to the max, and also
    felt similar to an Avengers movie as it had some connections to other Marvel characters. Star Wars on the other hand took a little bit
    of a more serious approach, but Star Wars has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I love the nostalgia of
    watching any Star Wars movie, but I love seeing it with modern technology being used to make it look just gorgeous! I also found
    this movie made me love the character Kylo Ren so much more. He seems like he has a much deeper character now. So, is there a
    number one? I have to say no, there are two number ones.
